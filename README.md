# Brain-Cancer-Image-Classification-with-CNN
This is a brain cancer image classification code with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch.

**Problem statement:**

In this problem, I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network to classify MRI images of normal brains and those with tumors. Tumors are also classified into 3 types of tumors, namely Glioma, Menigioma and Pituitary.
